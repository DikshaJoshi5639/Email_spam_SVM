# 📧 Email Fraud Detection using SVM (Spam vs Ham)

A machine learning project that classifies emails as **spam** or **ham** using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and hyperparameter tuning with **Grid Search**.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

The goal is to build a reliable classifier that detects fraudulent (spam) emails using supervised learning techniques. SVM is chosen for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and robustness against overfitting.

## 💡 Features

- Preprocessing of email text (tokenization, stop word removal, vectorization)
- Training using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- GridSearchCV for optimal hyperparameter tuning (kernel, C, gamma)
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Model interpretability and classification reports

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
